The app supports basic CRUD operations for managing TODO tasks and utilizes an SQLite database for data storage. It includes QR code generation and scanning features, allowing users to generate QR codes for demonstration purposes and scan both QR codes and barcodes to retrieve information, which can be copied to the clipboard.

Additionally, the app enables users to capture photos and record videos directly from within the app, requesting necessary permissions for accessing the device's gallery to store captured media. Both photos and videos can capture location data (latitude and longitude) when taken.

Finally, users have the capability to select photos from the device's gallery to display within the application as needed.
